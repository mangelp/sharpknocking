## What i must know to be a potential contributor? ##

I think that the fact that you are reading this page is enough to be a potential contributor :D, but for the sake of project's sanity (and mental sanity of devs) you should know some things:

  * C# coding experience
  * Basic knowledge about software patterns (What they are, what they are for, use of the most common ones, ...)

There are also some things where any knowledge will be well considered:

  * Security-related things that could be usefull: iptables, ipv6, ssl, cryptography, ...
  * C/C++ programming. Helpfull if we will need to code some native glue library to interface with C#.

## Getting started ##

Hey, congratulations, you make it to the fun part :D, so go to the Source tab and check the instructions to download and start to play with the code.

Once you get familiar with the current application and/or with the code and you can compile and run it from sources, you should subscribe to our [mailing list](http://mail.ilikecoffee.net/mailman/listinfo/sharpknocking-devel_ilikecoffee.net) hosted in ilikecoffee and talk with us.
