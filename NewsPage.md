**IptablesSharp subproject moved**

This is for now the only thing that have been a little bit active for a long time and now have been changed to another project to get a little bit of relevance.

The new project is called [NFSharp](http://code.google.com/p/nfsharp) and you will find there the old IptablesSharp.

The rest of the sharpknocking project code will remain untouched from now as there is no one working on this. We are very busy and the only one of us that was taking some bits of time to code is going to spend them in the new project.

Regards,

The Sharpknocking project team.

**Goodbye and hello**

We have been so busy fighting our current problems in our daily life that we had very little time (sadly) to work in the project. So the decision is taken, we are getting out of the open source contest held in the University of Seville, good luck to all the great projects there.

We want to note that we are not a dead project, but we are working very slowly.

Finally we are also proud to announce our inclusion in the list of server applications in the mono project's page:
http://www.mono-project.com/Software

Sadly none of us noticed it until today, thanks for it mono-guys!

Regards,

The sharpknocking project team.

**The second open source contest for students in the university of seville**

We have been very busy lately but we are managing to get some free time to spent again in the project.

We, the sharpknocking team, are proud to be again in this contest where we get to the
final phase the past year with a lot of illusion and ideas but with not too much free time.

You can follow the contest throught the page (spanish): [II Concurso Universitario de software libre](http://concurso-softwarelibre.us.es/)

You can also track our project blog (spanish again): [sharpknocking blog](http://projects.ilikecoffee.net/sharpknocking)

You can subscribe to our mailing list (feel free to use spanish or english when posting): [sharpknocking-devel](http://mail.ilikecoffee.net/mailman/listinfo/sharpknocking-devel_ilikecoffee.net)

**Project blog up**

Since yesterday the blog activity got restored.

The guilty is the spammers that send it using talkback links to the blog.

Dammed spammers!

**Project blog down**

This Sunday morning i discovered that our blog only prints this when it is accessed:

_JAWS Fatal Error:_
_Failed to fetch enabled data for registry_

We still don't know the causes for this but we will recover it soon.
