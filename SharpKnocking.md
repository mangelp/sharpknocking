## Main Idea ##

This project was born to participate in a open source contest in the University of Seville where we get it to the second position in the Systems category :D

Our main goal is to provide a suite of programs that will help to increase the security for a user computer with a low security knowledge or with no enough time to care about it.

## Why another port knocking implementation? ##

There are some implementation of the port knocking principles that are mature now (find them at http://www.portknocking.org), but the most are for console, none of them are written in c# :p, and as far as we know they don't feature a nice GUI interface.

## Suite components ##

This project has three main applications that does all the work.

  * [PortKnocker](PortKnocker.md)
  * [KnockingDaemon](KnockingDaemon.md)
  * [Doorman](Doorman.md)

There is also a new library/application bein developed

  * [IptablesNet](IptablesNet.md)

## Current Status ##

The current code is usefull ONLY for demostration purposses. The implementation is a lot limited and should not be used in any production enviroment of any kind.
